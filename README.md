# Shannon_group_theme by Andy Ba
This is a self-designed theme based on Underscores. There are several things you may need to know before using this theme:

1: This theme is not responsive. It is designed purely for desktop devices, especially for those with large screen.

2: This theme requires two important plugins: Contact Form 7 and LayerSlider. Make sure you have installed theme in your website. There are other plugins I used while developing the theme, but those are for debugging purpose only. 

3: To populate the website, please use the database file called test_db.sql.

4: It is recommended to use MAMP or WAMP to edit the theme if you want to use it as a base theme

5: To see what the theme should look like, I include three screenshots. If you see sth missing or broken, make sure you include the plugins and populate the website with the database file.

6: To use the theme, simply compress the shannon-group folder and upload it as normal theme file.
